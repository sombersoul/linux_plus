CompTIA Linux+
System Operations and Maintenance

2.1. Given a scenario, conduct software installations, configurations, updates, and removals.
2.1.1 Package types
	- .rpm
	- .deb
	- .tar
	- .tgz
	- .gz

2.1.2 Installation Tools
	- RPM
		Original Redhat Package Manager
	- Dpkg
		Debian package manager
	- APT
		Debian/Ubuntu package maanger front end, based on dpkg backend
	- YUM
		2nd Gen Redhat/CentOS package manager, based on RPM backend
	- DNF
		Dandified Yum; RHEL 8 and on default to DNF as the package manager
	- Zypper
		SUSE package manager based on RPM backend

2.1.3 Build tools
	- Commands
	- make
	- make install
		On Ubuntu (Debian?) systems, you can use checkinstall instead for ease of uninstalling using your system package manager
	- ldd
		Print shared object/library dependecies.
			ldd $(which <program>) will show library depencies.  Or use abs path to binary.
		ldconfig updates these links between libraries.  Need to learn more here.
			For instance, after a make install, if a new shared library is installed, ldconfig needs to
			be run to show the system that the library is now present and to be used.
	- Compilers
	- Shared Libraries

2.1.4 Repositories
	 - Configuration
	 - Creation
	 - Syncing
	 - Location

2.1.5 Acquisition Commands
	- wget
		This seems more focussed around single downloads of files/pages that are publically available.  Like a less featured curl.
		Supports HTTP/S, FTP
	- curl
		curl has all the acquisition ability of wget but also with credentialing.  It can also send POST requests, so info goes 2 ways.
		Supports large number of connection protocol (way more than wget) including SCP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, etc.


2.2. Given a scenario, manage users and groups.
2.2.1 Creation
	- useradd
		Default user settings found in /etc/default/useradd
		useradd -D shows default settings
	- groupadd


2.2.2 Modification
	- usermod
		Allows you to modify all things that were set in the useradd
	- groupmod
	- passwd
		Set or change the password for a user
	- chage
		Password expiration settings.
		chage <username> to run through the settings.
		chage <username> --list to see active settings

2.2.3 Deletion
	- userdel
	- groupdel

2.2.4 Queries
	- id
		List out ids for current user or id <username> for other user
	- whoami
	- who
		Show who is logged in
	- w
		Show who is logged in and what they are doing
	- last
		Shows the last logged in users

2.2.5 Quotas
	Limits the number of inotes or blocks that a group/user is allowed to consume within a given partition (usually the only one they have access to)
	1. In /etc/fstab, the partition must have usrquota and/or grpquota enabled
		fstab entries go like <device> <mount point> <filesystem> <settings> <0 or 1 for included in backup> <0 or number for order in fsck>
		E.g. UUID=0659e7c8-a71b-47b5-b77f-e4232ceecc01 /home ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 2
		Note: Later steps recommend journaled quota and the arch wiki has below as example:
			/dev/sda3 /home ext4 defaults,usrjquota=aquota.user,jqfmt=vfsv1 0 2
	2. Reboot for fstab changes to take affect (Stackoverflow suggests sudo mount <dir> -o remount would work to reapply whatever changes made to fstab)
	3. Go to root of partition for quotas and run "sudo quotacheck -amvug" for users and groups
	4. Turn quotas on with quotaon -v <partition root> or quotaon -av for all partitions that allow quotas.  quotaoff in reverse.
	5. repquota -av for a visual report of ongoing quotas
	6. edquota -u <username> or edquota -g <groupname> to set quotes for each.

	- User quota
	- Group quota

2.2.6 Profiles
	/etc/profile, .bash_profile, .profile and .bash_login are called for login shells in that order.
		/etc/profile.d/ is a directory for application or other startup scripts that are run when /etc/profile is called.
	/etc/bash.bashrc and .bashrc are called for no login shells in that order.
	- Bash parameters
	- User entries
	- .bashrc
	- .bash_profile
	- .profile
	- Global entries
	- /etc/bashrc
	- /etc/profile.d/
	- /etc/skel
	- /etc/profile

2.2.7 Important Files and File Contents
	- /etc/passwd
		Shows all users; passwords hidden; shows home, default shell/nologin, etc.
	- /etc/group
		Lists all groups and info
	- /etc/shadow
		Shows hashed passwords, required root
		An exclamation point in print of hash means account is locked
