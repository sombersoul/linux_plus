CompTIA Linux+
System Operations and Maintenance

2.1. Given a scenario, conduct software installations, configurations, updates, and removals.
2.1.1 Package types
	- .rpm
	- .deb
	- .tar
	- .tgz
	- .gz

2.1.2 Installation Tools
	- RPM
		Original Redhat Package Manager
	- Dpkg
		Debian package manager
	- APT
		Debian/Ubuntu package maanger front end, based on dpkg backend
	- YUM
		2nd Gen Redhat/CentOS package manager, based on RPM backend
	- DNF
		Dandified Yum; RHEL 8 and on default to DNF as the package manager
	- Zypper
		SUSE package manager based on RPM backend

2.1.3 Build tools
	- Commands
	- make
	- make install
		On Ubuntu (Debian?) systems, you can use checkinstall instead for ease of uninstalling using your system package manager
	- ldd
		Print shared object/library dependecies.
			ldd $(which <program>) will show library depencies.  Or use abs path to binary.
		ldconfig updates these links between libraries.  Need to learn more here.
			For instance, after a make install, if a new shared library is installed, ldconfig needs to
			be run to show the system that the library is now present and to be used.
	- Compilers
	- Shared Libraries

2.1.4 Repositories
	 - Configuration
	 - Creation
	 - Syncing
	 - Location

2.1.5 Acquisition Commands
	- wget
		This seems more focussed around single downloads of files/pages that are publically available.  Like a less featured curl.
		Supports HTTP/S, FTP
	- curl
		curl has all the acquisition ability of wget but also with credentialing.  It can also send POST requests, so info goes 2 ways.
		Supports large number of connection protocol (way more than wget) including SCP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, etc.


2.2. Given a scenario, manage users and groups.
2.2.1 Creation
	- useradd
		Default user settings found in /etc/default/useradd
		useradd -D shows default settings
	- groupadd


2.2.2 Modification
	- usermod
		Allows you to modify all things that were set in the useradd
	- groupmod
	- passwd
		Set or change the password for a user
	- chage
		Password expiration settings.
		chage <username> to run through the settings.
		chage <username> --list to see active settings

2.2.3 Deletion
	- userdel
	- groupdel

2.2.4 Queries
	- id
		List out ids for current user or id <username> for other user
	- whoami
	- who
		Show who is logged in
	- w
		Show who is logged in and what they are doing
	- last
		Shows the last logged in users

2.2.5 Quotas
	Limits the number of inotes or blocks that a group/user is allowed to consume within a given partition (usually the only one they have access to)
	1. In /etc/fstab, the partition must have usrquota and/or grpquota enabled
		fstab entries go like <device> <mount point> <filesystem> <settings> <0 or 1 for included in backup> <0 or number for order in fsck>
		E.g. UUID=0659e7c8-a71b-47b5-b77f-e4232ceecc01 /home ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 2
		Note: Later steps recommend journaled quota and the arch wiki has below as example:
			/dev/sda3 /home ext4 defaults,usrjquota=aquota.user,jqfmt=vfsv1 0 2
	2. Reboot for fstab changes to take affect (Stackoverflow suggests sudo mount <dir> -o remount would work to reapply whatever changes made to fstab)
	3. Go to root of partition for quotas and run "sudo quotacheck -amvug" for users and groups
	4. Turn quotas on with quotaon -v <partition root> or quotaon -av for all partitions that allow quotas.  quotaoff in reverse.
	5. repquota -av for a visual report of ongoing quotas
	6. edquota -u <username> or edquota -g <groupname> to set quotes for each.

	- User quota
	- Group quota

2.2.6 Profiles
	/etc/profile, .bash_profile, .profile and .bash_login are called for login shells in that order.
		/etc/profile.d/ is a directory for application or other startup scripts that are run when /etc/profile is called.
	/etc/bashrc and .bashrc are called for no login shells in that order.
	- Bash parameters
	- User entries
	- .bashrc
	- .bash_profile
	- .profile
	- Global entries
	- /etc/bashrc
	- /etc/profile.d/
	- /etc/skel
		Location of default dot files for new users.
	- /etc/profile

2.2.7 Important Files and File Contents
	- /etc/passwd
		Shows all users; passwords hidden; shows home, default shell/nologin, etc.
	- /etc/group
		Lists all groups and info
	- /etc/shadow
		Shows hashed passwords, required root
		An exclamation point in print of hash means account is locked


2.3. Given a scenario, create, modify, and redirect files.
2.3.1 Text editors
	- nano
	- vi

2.3.2 File readers
	- grep
	- cat
	- tail
	- head
	- less
	- more

2.3.3 Output redirection
	-<
	->
	-|
	-<<
	->>
	-2>
	-&>
	- stdin
	- stdout
	- stderr
	- /dev/null
		Black hole to swallow unwanted output
	- /dev/tty
		Controlling terminal for the current process.
	- xargs
		For running a single command on a list of input (normally file names), such as...
			ls | xargs -n 1 chgrp admin
		It accepts the stdin as the final argument, so the above executes chgrp admin <filename> on each of the files given by ls.
	- tee
		Puts a tee in the pipeline of stdin and stdout.  Takes input, allows output to file, and passes stdin to stdout.
		ls | tee listing.txt | xargs -n 1 echo "File -->"
	- Here documents
		Reads text in place as stdin from word to word. Ex below:
			wc -w <<EOF
			This is a sentence.
			Here are more lines.
			EOF

2.3.4 Text processing
	- grep
	 -tr
		Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.
	- echo
	- sort
	- awk
	- sed
		Generally, sed matches an address (like a regex) and applies some command to the matched address on the incoming stream.
		Input file can be suppled, if left off it takes stdin
		sed "<pattern> <command>" <inputfile>
			Find and replace format: sed "s/<regex to find>/<replacement>" <filename>
		sed scripts can be concatenated internally with a ;
			sed "<pattern> <command>; <pattern> <command>" <filename>
	- cut
		Separates stream in to selectable sections based on delimiter (default tab)
		ls | cut -d. -f1   --> This pipes ls into cut, where it splits on delimiter . and takes field 1, the filename.
	- printf
		Just like fprintf from MATLAB.  prinf "Formatting this %s with a %d and a %2.3f" string 10 10
	- egrep
		Utilizes extended regex expressions (allows some other special characters).  grep -E is more recommended than egrep
	- wc
	- paste
		Converts tab separated (or other delim) stream into new line stream
			ls | paste

2.3.5 File and directory operations
	- touch
	- mv
	- cp
	- rm
	- scp
	- ls
		ls -a (all)
		ls -l (long)
			You can see how many hard links a file has by the number after the permissions
			[jonathan@localhost sandbox]$ ls -li fileA.txt hardlinktoA
			1703949 -rw-rw-r--. 2 jonathan jonathan 0 Aug 26 00:08 fileA.txt
			1703949 -rw-rw-r--. 2 jonathan jonathan 0 Aug 26 00:08 hardlinktoA
		ls -i (inode)
	- rsync
	- mkdir
	- rmdir
	- ln
		- Symbolic (soft)
			File that points to another file.  Similar to MS shortcuts
			Breaks if the original file is deleted, moved, renamed.
			Creates new inode
		- Hard
			Creates another name for the same inode/file.
			Survives deletion of others
	- unlink
		Safely removes links
	- inodes
			inodes store the following metadata:
				File type: regular file, directory, pipe etc.
				Permissions to that file: read, write, execute
				Link count: The number of hard link relative to an inode
				User ID: owner of file
				Group ID: group owner
				Size of file: or major/minor number in case of some special files
				Time stamp: access time, modification time and (inode) change time
				Attributes: immutable' for example
				Access control list: permissions for special users/groups
				Link to location of file
				Other metadata about the file
			Blocks, which are referenced by the inode table, are various sizes depending on the file system
				Block Size for Ext2 can be 1Kb, 2Kb, 4Kb, 8Kb
				Block Size for Ext3 can be 1Kb, 2Kb, 4Kb, 8Kb
				Block Size for Ext4 can be 1Kb to 64Kb
	- find
		Returns full path to thing searched for based on all options given
			find . -type f -name "*filename*"
		This command is weird that the long forms are not --
	- locate
		Not on most systems by default anymore.  Similar to find.
		Very fast search for files because it is pulling from a database (updatedb) not actually searching the filesystem
	- grep
	- which
	- whereis
		Locates all relevent files, binaries, and confs of a command
			whereis python
			whereis yum
	- diff
		A way of comparing the differences between two files.  Seems very unreadable format...
	- updatedb
		Database that locate uses to search from.  Automatically updated daily from cron job (/etc/cron.daily/mlocate)

2.4 Given a scenario, manage services.
2.4.1 Systemd management
	- Systemctl
		systemctl on its own lists running services
		- Enabled
		- Disabled
		- Start
		- Stop
		- Mask
			Masking makes a service unstartable
			Find masked services with systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep mask
		- Restart
		- Status
		- Daemon-reload
			reloads systemd manager configuration
	- systemd-analyze blame
		Lists out how long each process in the boot took to run.  helps for boot debugging
		systemd-analyze plot > index.html creates a cool html page to view boot steps.
	- Unit files
		https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files
		- Directory locations
			/etc/systemd/system for all unit files by default
		- Environment parameters
			systemctl edit <service>
			This will create a directory in service location with a conf file where you can set something like...
				[SERVICE]
				environment="KEY=MYSECRETKEYSTUFF"
				environment="USER=USERNAMEHERE"
		- Targets
			These are your basic system commands.  Run the below to command to list them all (like shutdown)
			#systemctl list-units --type=target --all
		- Hostnamectl
			Used to query and change the hostname and its related settings
		- Automount
			Automounting is controlled through autofs
			You can edit the config file /etc/auto.master to make automount locations similar to /etc/fstab but
				these only get mounted when the service is run (systemctl start autofs.service), rather than at boot time
				unless that service is enabled.  You can change the config file, reload the service, and the new mounts will set.
