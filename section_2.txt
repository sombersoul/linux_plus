CompTIA Linux+
System Operations and Maintenance

2.1. Given a scenario, conduct software installations, configurations, updates, and removals.
2.1.1 Package types
	- .rpm
	- .deb
	- .tar
	- .tgz
	- .gz

2.1.2 Installation Tools
	- RPM
		Original Redhat Package Manager
	- Dpkg
		Debian package manager
	- APT
		Debian/Ubuntu package maanger front end, based on dpkg backend
	- YUM
		2nd Gen Redhat/CentOS package manager, based on RPM backend
	- DNF
		Dandified Yum; RHEL 8 and on default to DNF as the package manager
	- Zypper
		SUSE package manager based on RPM backend

2.1.3 Build tools
	- Commands
	- make
	- make install
		On Ubuntu (Debian?) systems, you can use checkinstall instead for ease of uninstalling using your system package manager
	- ldd
		Print shared object/library dependecies.
			ldd $(which <program>) will show library depencies.  Or use abs path to binary.
		ldconfig updates these links between libraries.  Need to learn more here.
			For instance, after a make install, if a new shared library is installed, ldconfig needs to
			be run to show the system that the library is now present and to be used.
	- Compilers
	- Shared Libraries

2.1.4 Repositories
	 - Configuration
	 - Creation
	 - Syncing

2.1.5 Acquisition Commands
	- wget
		This seems more focussed around single downloads of files/pages that are publically available.  Like a less featured curl.
		Supports HTTP/S, FTP
	- curl
		curl has all the acquisition ability of wget but also with credentialing.  It can also send POST requests, so info goes 2 ways.
		Supports large number of connection protocol (way more than wget) including SCP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, etc.
